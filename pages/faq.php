                    <b>What is Open RSC?</b><br/>
                    Began in July 2018, the Open RSC project has been a community driven open source initiative to
                    strive for as close of a replica RSC game experience as possible.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Can I donate or subscribe for perks?</b><br/>
                    No donations or subscriptions are accepted. We don't need any money.<br/><br/>

                    <b>How often is Open RSC updated?</b><br/>
                    Multiple times per week.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Is this a replica? What is the experience rate?</b><br/>
                    Experience rate is set at 1x. We strive to be a replica.<br/><br/>

                    <b>Is a single player version available?</b><br/>
                    Yes! Visit the <a href="https://github.com/open-rsc/game"/>GitHub</a> page for more
                    information.<br/><br/>

                    <b>How do I run my own Open RSC private server?</b><br/>
                    <a href="https://github.com/open-rsc/game"/>Follow this guide on GitHub.</a><br/><br/>

                    <b>Who are the Open RSC admins?</b><br/>

                    <b>What is Open RSC's stance on botting?</b><br/>

                    instructions. Open RSC is Windows, Mac, and Linux
                    compatible!<br/><br/>

                    <b>Any future plans for development?</b><br/>
                    We want to maintain a traditional RSC server but also build a few fun servers with all sorts of
                    features and you too can run on your own instance!
