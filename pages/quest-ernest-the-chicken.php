								<span class="d-block">To start the quest, talk to Veronica at the entrance to Draynor Manor, located to the north of Draynor Village. She explains that herself and her fianc√©, Ernest, were lost. Ernest went into the mansion to get directions and he hasn't returned, and asks you to go into the mansion to find him. Note that there are Ghosts, a level 25 Witch, and a level 21 Skeleton in the manor but that they are all non-aggressive.</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Go into the manor and go up the stairs, then go up the nearby ladder to reach the top floor. Talk to Professor Oddenstein. When you ask him about Ernest, he says that Ernest is helping him with his experiments but that he was turned into a Chicken by the professor's "pouletmorph machine."</span>
								<span class="pt-3 d-block">He can transform him back, but his machine is no longer working and the "house gremlins" have ran off with parts needed to get it working again. He says the parts are either in the manor or on its grounds, and that he needs a Pressure Gauge, Rubber Tube and an Oil Can.</span>

								<span class="pt-3 d-block">Now go to the eastern-most room, pick up the Spade, and then head outside. Walk around to the west side of the manor. Do not approach the trees as they will do some damage based on how many Hits you have. Once you're on the west side go a little further south to the fountain. Use the Poisoned Fish Food on the fountain, which will kill some piranhas. Now search the fountain and you will obtain the Pressure Gauge.</span>

Note that the Skeleton is non-aggressive, so you won't have to worry about him attacking you at low levels. Use the key on the door again to leave the room.</span>
