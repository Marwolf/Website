								Speak with the Cook on Lumbridge Castle's first floor. He will tell the player that he needs ingredients to make a cake for the Duke of Lumbridge's birthday. He wants the player to retrieve flour, milk, and an egg, and to bring those items back to him. Before you set off and collect your ingredients, pick up the pot that's sitting nearby on a table, which you will need later. You'll also want to purchase a bucket from the nearby General Store.</span>
